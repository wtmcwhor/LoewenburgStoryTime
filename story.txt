There I was, driving my BMW down the autobahn at 300kph. 
I was jamming to my favorite industrial metal band Rammstein and dreaming of enjoying beer when I arrive at Oktoberfest.
Suddenly, after turning onto Berlin's Hauptstrasse, I realized it was only March, and Oktoberfest is in.... October! 
I then decided I could do a ratskeller crawl instead.
Driving down Hauptstrasse in my Porsche, I couldn't resist the aroma of fresh Brot emanating from the Baeckerei on the corner, so I pulled over to buy some Gebaeck.
Yes, I was driving both a BMW and a Porsche. I hopped in the Baeckerei and bought a slice of apfelkuchen when I saw the most amazing thing!
I saw the biggest Schloss of my life and it had Klimaanlage!
I stuck around in the Schloss, and ate all the Bratwurst inside. Oh man. Not feeling so good. 
I was so excited to visit Eltz Castle, but upon arrival, I was disappointed to discover that they had closed early for the day.
And to think my day couldnt get any worst, as i was walking back to my car... a big hund started chasing after me!!!
